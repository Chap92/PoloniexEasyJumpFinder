# PoloniexEasyJumpFinder
Analyzes cryptocurrencies at the Poloniex trading platform using predictive analysis.

This script tries to predict which crypto-currency is most likely to see the largest change in value. For this purpose, it measures factors such as:

1) The difference between the asking and bidding prices

2) The ask order strength

3) The bid order strength

4) Amount of bitcoins needs to change 1 point.


Since consumer decision is partially based on the 24 hour percentage change of a currency, this script will hopefully predict which currency will dominate the trading platform in the next 24 hours.

** This was written in python 3.4. If you have a version below 3, you will have to make some adjustments to the code for it to work.
